# Copilot instructions — Jekyll site

Short, actionable guidance to help AI coding agents work productively in this repository.

## Big picture
- This repo is a small Jekyll site. Source content lives at the repository root and in `_posts/`. The site is built into `_site/` (generated output) — do not edit files under `_site/`.
- The site uses the `minima` theme and the `jekyll-feed` plugin; see `_config.yml` for configuration.

## Key locations (examples)
- Site config: [_config.yml](_config.yml)
- Source index page: [index.markdown](index.markdown)
- About page source: [about.markdown](about.markdown)
- Posts: [_posts/2025-12-13-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown](_posts/2025-12-13-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown)
- Generated output (build artifact): `_site/` (example generated post: [_site/jekyll/update/2025/12/13/welcome-to-jekyll.html](_site/jekyll/update/2025/12/13/welcome-to-jekyll.html))

## Developer workflows (exact commands)
- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Build the site: `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Serve locally with livereload for iterative edits: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
- Verify changes by inspecting `_site/` after a build. Commit only source files, not `_site/`.

## Project-specific conventions
- Content source vs generated output: edit Markdown and front matter in the repository root and `_posts/`. Do not edit anything inside `_site/` — it is regenerated by Jekyll.
- Post filenames must follow Jekyll convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown` and include YAML front matter. See `_posts/2025-12-13-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` for an example.
- The repository currently relies on the remote `minima` theme (no `_layouts/` directory present). If a layout change is required, update `_config.yml` or add a local `_layouts/`/`_includes/` folder.

## Small examples
- Minimal post front matter to match existing site conventions:
```yaml
---
title: "My new post"
date: 2025-12-15 12:00:00 -0000
layout: post
---

Post content here.
```

## Integration & deployment notes
- The repository uses Bundler + Jekyll. CI or GitHub Pages deployments should run `bundle exec jekyll build` and publish the contents of `_site/`.
- Because this repo uses a gem-based theme (`minima`), check `_config.yml` before adding plugins or unsupported gems that GitHub Pages may not allow.

## Quick do/don't checklist for agents
- Do: edit `index.markdown`, `about.markdown`, files under `_posts/`, and `_config.yml`.
- Do: run `bundle exec jekyll build` locally and verify output in `_site/` before opening PRs.
- Don't: edit or commit files from `_site/`.

If anything here is unclear or you want more repository-specific examples (layouts, custom includes, or deployment steps), ask for maintainers' preferences before making layout or deployment changes.
