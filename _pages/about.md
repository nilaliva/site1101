Hi! My name is Nilay Aliyeva, I'm 17 years old, and I've been passionate about computers since I was 10. My journey began at the Junior IT Academy Step IT, and by the age of 12, I started learning programming with Python. At 15, after completing the junior academy, I moved on to the senior academy to further develop my programming skills, and I've been actively working in the field ever since.

Alongside programming, I also work in SMM and create, shoot, and edit videos for various projects. I believe that learning alone is not enough—the more you work, the more you grow and achieve.

Sports are another big part of my life. I focus on figure skating, which teaches me discipline, persistence, and balance—both on the ice and in life. I'm currently in my first year at ADA University, studying Information Technology, and I recently started working as a software developer at Logix.

I love what I do, and I'm always eager to learn, create, and push myself to new heights—both in technology and beyond.
